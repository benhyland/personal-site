title: Hello :)

Welcome to my website.

I'm Ben Hyland, a softie based in London.

I keep a very occasional blog, mostly of notes on learning new technologies.
This is also a convenient place to record links and notes that aren't yet deserving of proper posts, projects or decent burials.

If for some reason you are interested in what I've been doing, please get in touch: [mail@bhyland.co.uk](mailto:mail@bhyland.co.uk). My CV and links to my rather minimal impingement on the web are around here somewhere.
I don't have a faceboot or a tweeter.

Have a good day!
