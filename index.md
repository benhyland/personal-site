title: Hello :)

Welcome to my website.

I'm Ben Hyland, a softie based in London.

I keep a blog, mostly of notes on learning new technologies.
This is also a convenient place to record links and notes that aren't yet deserving of proper posts or project management.

If for some reason you are interested in what I've been doing, my CV and links to my rather minimal inpingement on the web are around here somewhere.
I don't have a faceboot or a tweeter.
