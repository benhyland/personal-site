title: Systema.
summary: Notes on systema principles and practice.
---

On and off, I do a bit of exercise with Systema, a Russian "reality-based" (as opposed to sport focused) martial art.

I have ended up with a few notes on the general principles and on some common exercises.

I find these helpful when I try to explain what it's about to someone new, which happens occasionally as Systema is still moderately obscure in the UK.

It's also nice to remind myself what I like to play with when I eventually go back to class.

Good to remember: it's not a competition.

## The 4 pillars of Systema

Focus on one or all of these in every exercise.

#### Breathing

* In through the nose, out through the mouth.
* Breathing out to release tension from hits.
* Patterned breathing, e.q. square breathing for running exercise or doubled breathing for faster recovery.
* Breath holding for generating mental stress.
* Shallow breathing when restricted by a lock or during ground work.
* Don't forget to breathe!
* Continuous breathing that is not too fast or too slow for the situation helps save energy.

#### Relaxation

* Remain flexible and adaptive.
* Conserve energy by using only the muscles needed.
* Use selective tension to provide structure to an opponent, then take it away.
* Helps prevent injury.

#### Form

* Vertical spine is usually good structure.
* Good posture allows easier movement and avoidance, and more efficient power generation.
* Strong structure is defensive as well as a good base for controlling the structure of others.

#### Continuous movement

* Moving targets are harder to hit!

## Useful tools

*   A hard surface

    A sprung wooden floor is forgiving but hard enough to make mistakes clear; grass is less good once you begin to gain confidence as it forgives too much.

*   A wall.

    Walls can be good for exercise, for learning use of space and footwork, for structural support.

*   A stick.

    Great for footwork and timing, ok for massage, good when working close contact for learning leverage and instinctive biomechanics.

*   A sledgehammer.

    Can be fun for exercise.

*   A training knife.

    Can be fun for timing and stress work, and great for control, but less useful for me as I don't want to train in the expectation of getting into a knife fight. Run away!


## Movements to include

* Moving inside and outside an attack.
* Avoiding while maintaining structure, in the ballroom-dancing, pivoting, weight transfer sense.
* Duck walking.
* Movement while grounded - rolls, crawling, forbidding certain limbs.
* Changing levels - avoidance, rolls, takedowns focused on structural weak points, working from the ground against a standing opponent.

## Traditional exercises

Often creatively combined with each other, with random non-traditional exercises, and with some minor pummelling.

* Squats.
* Pushups.
* Situps.
* Leg raises.
* Selective tension and relaxation.
* Rolls and falls.
* Force (generally spiralling) against a resisting partner.

Exercises can be tried slow, fast, and with particular patterns of breathing or with no breath.

Form should be varied often.

## Hits

* Varying strength and depth.
* Right on the surface for pain compliance work and structure shocks.
* Slow and deep, moving towards pushes.
* Gravity based, very relaxed with heavy hands.
* Accuracy, for stop hits and to penetrate defence.
* Agression as a defence.
* Hits specifically to deform structure.
* Hits to attack weapons (e.g. arms).
* Boxing style - high elbow, straight line from shoulder, shoulder moves first for a whipped arm, tension only at the last second.

## Legs

* Small work, keeping low - great for stop hits.
* Pushes.
* For attacks at multiple levels simultaneously.
* For working from the ground.

## Pad work

* Side kicks - great exercise, but not hugely practical. Keep that leg high!
* With focus mits:
  Continuous movement and varying intensity.
  Figure eight.
  Aggression vs defense, for movement across a room.

## Control work (the fun bit)
* Locks.
* Takedowns - whatever works.
* Pushes.
* Maintaining a particular distance - following and leading.
* Control from the head.
* Control from joints.
