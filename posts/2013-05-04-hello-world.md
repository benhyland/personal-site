title: Hello World
summary: because reasons

I'm starting this blog as part of some mini-projects I am doing between jobs.
I've been installing FreeBSD on my laptop, learning how to use git and github a little bit, learning a little more vim, looking at Play framework and websockets. I may take another look at one of my old "let's learn Scala" projects (to do with pasting schemes on bicategories) and see how much it horrifies me.

Assuming I don't get distracted I'll put some of my notes up and see where this goes. This is mostly for my own benefit but if you find it useful or have any comments please do let me know.
