title: Artists
summary: Artists of interest

I've been a bit busy for the last year or so.

Second, I got a new job with [Government Digital Services](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service/about).
I'm going to enjoy working with a group which prioritises user needs so highly.

First, I moved house. Now I have enough wall space to put up some prints that have been hiding away for a few years.

This post is just an unordered list of interesting artists. Some I might own something of, others I just want to follow up on.

Apologies to anyone else who reads this - de gustibus non disputandum est.
