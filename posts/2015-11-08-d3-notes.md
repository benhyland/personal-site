title: Notes on D3
summary: Some notes on using d3.js simply for table management, without further visualisations.
---

Last year we picked up d3 to clean up a couple of horrendous pages of javascript doing basic dom manipulation. I thought at the time that I should do a lighning talk or workshop for those who hadn't used d3 before, but never got around to it. Now I'm just recording the notes I would have used as a basis.

[Docs here](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki).

#### Introducing d3 concepts

##### To introduce a new field
- select() single element
- bind data
- enter() [append(), text()]

##### To update a field
- select() single element
- bind data
- update() [text()]

##### To remove a field
- select() single element
- bind data
- exit() [remove()]

#### Normal usage pattern, e.g. for rows in a table

##### To handle multiple fields at once
- selectAll() multiple elements
- bind data with key function
- enter() [append(), text()]
- exit() [remove()]
- update()

##### To handle hardcoded nested data per field
- selectAll() multiple elements
- bind data with key function
- select() single sub element, for nested select
- enter() [append(), text()]
- exit() [remove()]
- update()

##### To handle arbitrary nested data per field
- selectAll() multiple elements
- bind data with key function
- selectAll() multiple sub elements, for nested select
- enter() [append(), text()]
- exit() [remove()]
- update()

#### Virtual dom representation

Notice that d3 selections are always represented as array of arrays - this covers single element, multiple elements, single subselect, multiple subselect.

Notice differing availablility of bound data as a result, and that data bound at the top level in the array of array form will end up binding elements to leaves.

- what happens when you selectAll().select().selectAll(), or when you selectAll().selectAll(), or when you select().select(), or when you select().selectAll()

#### Classes and attributes

- select single element
- bind data
- enter() [append(), classed(), attr()]
- notice what happens when you attr() twice in a row. This is an easy pitfall. Also show the interaction with classed().

#### Ordered data

sort(), ascending(), descending(), insert()

#### Data binding
- data(), to set the value on a particular selection (before updating that selection)
- datum(), to transform the value on a particular selection (before updating that selection)
- [Full explanation here](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/)

#### Events

- attach handlers to a selection e.g. selectAll().on("click" foo)

#### Effects

- each() - perform an effect across the selection
