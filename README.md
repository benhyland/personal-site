personal-site
=============

A [hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) project to record some of the process of learning FreeBSD, git, Play etc.
May eventually turn into a personal website.

first build with `ghc --make site.hs`
then `./site build`
or `./site rebuild` (if we recompile site.hs)
run locally with `./site preview`
deploy by copying generated files under `_site` somewhere that can serve them.

This site should be deployed at [bhyland.co.uk](http://bhyland.co.uk)
